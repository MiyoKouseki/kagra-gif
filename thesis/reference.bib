We discuss the implications of Newtonian noise for future third generation gravitational wave detectors. The relevant seismic wave fields are predominately of human origin and are dependent on local infrastructure and population density. Seismic studies presented here show that considerable seismic noise reduction is possible compared to current detector locations. A realistic seismic amplitude spectral density of a suitably quiet site should not exceed 0.5 nm/(Hz/f)2 above 1 Hz. Newtonian noise models have been developed both analytically and by finite element analysis. These show that the contribution to Newtonian noise from surface waves due to distance sources significantly reduces with depth. Seismic displacements from local sources and body waves then become the dominant contributors to the Newtonian fluctuations.}

A critical factor to the performance of the interferometers, and a major consideration in the design of possible future upgrades, is isolation of the interferometer optics from seismic noise. We present the results of a detailed programme of measurements of the seismic environment surrounding the LIGO interferometers. We describe the experimental configuration used to collect the data, which were acquired over a 613 day period. The measurements focused on the frequency range 0.1–10 Hz, in which the secondary microseismic peak and noise due to human activity in the vicinity of the detectors was found to be particularly critical to the interferometer performance. We compare the statistical distribution of the data sets from the two interferometer sites, construct amplitude spectral densities of seismic noise amplitude fluctuations with periods of up to 3 months and analyse the data for any long-term trends in the amplitude of seismic noise in this critical frequency range.}
