abstract = {We developed an interferometric testbed to stabilize environmental motions over time scales of several hours and a length scale of 1 m. Typically, thermal and seismic motions on the ground are larger than 1 $¥mu$m over these scales, affecting the precision of more sensitive measurements. To suppress such motions, we built an active stabilization system composed of interferometric sensors, a hexapod actuator, and a frequency-stabilized laser. With this stabilized testbed, environmental motions were suppressed down to the nanometer level. This system will allow us to perform sensitive measurements, such as ground testing of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, in the presence of environmental noise.},

	journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
	abstract = {At present a 10 m prototype interferometer facility is being set up at the AEI Hannover. One unique feature of the prototype will be the suspension platform interferometer (SPI). The purpose of the SPI is to monitor and stabilize the relative motion between three seismically isolated optical tables. The in-vacuum tables are suspended in an L-shaped configuration with an arm length of 11.65 m. The design goal of the SPI is to stabilize longitudinal differential displacements to a level of 100 pm between 10 mHz and 100 Hz and relative angular noise of 10 nrad in the same frequency band. This paper covers the optical layout, signal processing and design aspects of the SPI, e.g. cross-coupling between the different degrees of freedom and fibre pointing noise are investigated. A simulation is presented which shows that with the chosen optical design of the SPI all degrees of table motion can be sensed in a fully decoupled way.}

Table 3 gives station corrections; table 4, revised figures for the effect of epicentral distance. It is found that for epicentral distances between about 20° and 175° the average observed amplitudes correspond closely to those calculated with an absorption coefficient k = 0.0003 per km. For paths completely outside or inside the Pacific Basin, k = 0.0002± per km., while for paths tangent to its boundary the amplitudes of surface waves with periods of about 20 seconds may be reduced by two-thirds or more (in extreme cases by almost nine-tenths) through reflection or refraction of energy; such seismograms of shallow shocks may be taken as indicating intermediate depth of focus.}",

We discuss the implications of Newtonian noise for future third generation gravitational wave detectors. The relevant seismic wave fields are predominately of human origin and are dependent on local infrastructure and population density. Seismic studies presented here show that considerable seismic noise reduction is possible compared to current detector locations. A realistic seismic amplitude spectral density of a suitably quiet site should not exceed 0.5 nm/(Hz/f)2 above 1 Hz. Newtonian noise models have been developed both analytically and by finite element analysis. These show that the contribution to Newtonian noise from surface waves due to distance sources significantly reduces with depth. Seismic displacements from local sources and body waves then become the dominant contributors to the Newtonian fluctuations.}

	abstract = {The LIGO experiment aims to detect and study gravitational waves using ground-based laser interferometry. A critical factor to the performance of the interferometers, and a major consideration in the design of possible future upgrades, is isolation of the interferometer optics from seismic noise. We present the results of a detailed programme of measurements of the seismic environment surrounding the LIGO interferometers. We describe the experimental configuration used to collect the data, which were acquired over a 613 day period. The measurements focused on the frequency range 0.1–10 Hz, in which the secondary microseismic peak and noise due to human activity in the vicinity of the detectors was found to be particularly critical to the interferometer performance. We compare the statistical distribution of the data sets from the two interferometer sites, construct amplitude spectral densities of seismic noise amplitude fluctuations with periods of up to 3 months and analyse the data for any long-term trends in the amplitude of seismic noise in this critical frequency range.}
